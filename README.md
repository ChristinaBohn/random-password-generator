# random-password-generator
## In this project, I am creating a Javascript-powered password generator.
This application runs in the browser and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to allow the user to generate a password of desired length between 8 and 128 characters and including numbers, symbols, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. Password criteria are selected via prompts.

## What I learned
This project was a great dive into Javascript, exploring variables, arrays, conditional statements, and fitting them all together into a functional application.
